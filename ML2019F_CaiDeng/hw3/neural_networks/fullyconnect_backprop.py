    The backpropagation process of fullyconnect
      input parameter:
          in_sensitivity  : the sensitivity from the upper layer, shape: 
                          : [number of images, number of outputs in feedforward]

          weight          : the weight matrix of this layer, shape: 
                          : [number of inputs in feedforward, number of outputs in feedforward]

      output parameter:
          weight_grad     : the gradient of the weights, shape: 
                          : [number of inputs in feedforward, number of outputs in feedforward]

                          : [number of outputs in feedforward, 1]

                          : [number of images, number of inputs in feedforward]

    Note : remember to divide by number of images in the calculation of gradients.
